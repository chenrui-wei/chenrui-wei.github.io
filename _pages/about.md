Hi! My name is Chenrui Wei (魏陈锐). I am currently a researcher at the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI). My research primarily focuses on the intersection of artificial intelligence with mathematics and physics. Prior to joining BIGAI, I earned my M.S. degree in Applied Mathematics from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and my B.S. degree in Mathematics from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

Driven by real-world industrial challenges, my passion for artificial intelligence was ignited. I am dedicated to advancing the field and striving towards the goal of achieving human-level intelligence. Feel free to email me if you are interested in working together.
