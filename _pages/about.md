Hi! My name is Chenrui Wei (魏陈锐). I am currently a research engineer at the Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI). My research primarily focuses on AI4MATH and complex planning. Prior to joining BIGAI, I earned my M.S. degree in Applied Mathematics from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and my B.S. degree in Mathematics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC).

Driven by real-world industrial challenges, my passion for artificial intelligence was ignited. I am dedicated to advancing the field and striving towards the goal of achieving human-level intelligence. *Currently, I am seeking collaborators for active reasoning and theorem proving projects*, as well as a PhD position in this field. If you're interested in collaborating, please feel free to reach out.
