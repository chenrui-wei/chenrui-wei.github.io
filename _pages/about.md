Hi! I’m Chenrui Wei (魏陈锐), a research engineer at ByteDance specializing in automated reasoning and AI for theorem proving. My passion for artificial intelligence was sparked by real-world industrial challenges. I am committed to advancing the field and working toward the long-term goal of human-level or even superintelligence.
